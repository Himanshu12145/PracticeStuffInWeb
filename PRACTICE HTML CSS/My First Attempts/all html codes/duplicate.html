    <h1 class="text_background_color font_weight">MONSTERS</h1>
    <p class="text_background_color"> The contributors to <a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/monster-theory"target="_blank">Monsters</a> Theory consider beasts, demons, freaks and fiends as symbolic expressions of cultural unease that pervade a society and shape its collective behavior. Through a historical sampling of monsters, these essays argue that our fascination for the monstrous testifies to our continued desire to explore difference and prohibition.

    Tilapias are tropical, mainly freshwater, cichlid fish, native to Africa and parts of the Middle East. They were transported worldwide in the early part of the 20th Century for the biological control of aquatic weeds and insects, the aquarium trade, as bait fish and for aquaculture. Through intentional and accidental introductions of tilapia into aquatic ecosystems outside their natural distribution, these fish have established themselves across the world, including India. Their simple food requirements, tolerance to different environmental conditions, rapid growth, high reproductive rates and aggressive disposition have allowed them to colonise new areas, often at the expense of native fish populations. Once established, tilapia are nearly impossible to eradicate; earning them a spot in the top 100 of the world’s worst introduced species in the Global Invasive Species Database. The fishers also reported an invasive carp that they simply called ‘China’. Unsurprisingly, invasive fish now constitute the predominant catch in many parts of the Yamuna.

    While Mayawati is plain-speak in the region’s piscine parlance, we couldn’t quite comprehend this coinage until one fisherman laughingly remarked, “uski jaisi sab kuch kha jati hai” (devours everything like she does), hinting at allegations of huge personal wealth accumulated when she was in power. Femme or fish, Mayawati was clearly loathed here. Nevertheless, this sobriquet was often a useful icebreaker to begin conversing with the many fishers we met, and how better than to start with a good laugh! </p>
